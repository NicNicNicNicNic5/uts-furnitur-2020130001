                Our history begins since 1950 with Nicholas's creativity to make a pot clay. The structure<BR>
                about the pot is unique that no other than him understand what it's purpose about doing so<BR>
                He then created more and more unique and bizzare structures and it captivated Bandung's mayor<BR>
                and since then our company rose to the top with futuristic theme to help you decorate your home.
